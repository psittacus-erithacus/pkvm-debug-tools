pkvm-tools contains the pkvm-dbg-tools module and tools for building initramfs.
pkvm modules are loaded at kernel startup, so they must be in the initramfs.

pkvm-dbg-tools provides debug tools for debugging the hypervisor
	print-s2-mapping
		print host and guests stage-2 mappings
	count-shared-mappings
		print and count shared mappings
	hyp_print function for EL2 code
		debug printings from hypervisor

Build instructions:
The following variables must be defined:
	KERNEL_DIR points to the Kernel source code directory
	UBUNTU_DIR points to ubuntu root directory
	CROSS_COMPILE points to cross compiler
	OUT_IMAGE image where the compressed initramfs will be copied

make pkvm-dbg-tools
make initramfs
make -C initramfs install 

you can configure the kernel to use the generated cpio file as the internal
initramfs by setting the configuration option CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE
to point to the generated cpio file
Pkvm modules are loaded from initramfs and pkvm prevents them from being 
loaded later.
