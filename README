pkvm-debug-tools contains  stuff for pkvm debugging.

pkvm-debug-module: pkvm loadable module that containt tools for pkvm debugging
	print-s2-mapping
		print host and guests stage-2 mappings
	count-shared-mappings
		print and count shared mappings
	hyp_print function for EL2 code
		debug printings from hypervisor
	ramlog handling
	
utils/hypdbg: very simple tool user for using the debugger
utils/hypdbgrs: rust based user tool user for using the debugger
utils/decrypt-hyplog: tool for decrypting ramlog

initramfs: tools for building initramfs. 
pkvm modules are loaded at kernel startup, so they must be in the initramfs
pkvm prevents them from being loaded later.

Build instructions:
The following variables must be defined:
	KERNEL_DIR points to the Kernel source code directory
	UBUNTU_DIR points to ubuntu root directory
	CROSS_COMPILE points to cross compiler
	OUT_IMAGE image where the compressed initramfs will be copied

make pkvm-dbg-tools
make initramfs
make -C initramfs install 

you can configure the kernel to use the generated cpio file as the internal
initramfs by setting the configuration option CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE
to point to the generated cpio file
